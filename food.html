						<h1>Traditional Foods and Food Habits in Bangladesh</h1>
						<p>Every country has its own tradition of foods. Bangladesh has also the same. In the sense of food habits, Bangladesh is influenced by the regional variations of her history. Being an outpost of Mughal Empire once, Bangladesh retains its heritage. Bangladesh is famous for rice production which has been the chief occupation of its people. Rice therefore the main food of Bangladesh. The Bangladeshis eat rice, not just a small quantity but a lot. They eat rice every day and at every meal with great testy and spicy curry of vegetables, fishes and meat.</p>

						<h3 class="h3_design_block">Bangladeshi Noboborsho Feast-Panta Bhat, Ilish Maach</h3>
						<p>Noboborsho is celebrated by the people as first day of Bengali New Year on 14 April in Bangladesh and on 15 April in the West Bengal. This day is also called as Pohela Boishakh. The word Pohela stands for first day and Boishak is the first month of Bengali calendar. The most colourful Pohela Boishakh (Bengali new year’s day) festival now takes place in Dhaka. Large numbers of people gather early in the morning under the banyan tree at Ramna Park where chhayanaut artists open the day with Tagore’s famous song, Eso he Baishakh eso eso (Come O Baishakh, come), welcoming Baishakh.</p>
						<p>In pohela boishak, Bengali businessman perform Haalkhata festival which is the ritual of closing the old ledger and opening a new one with new entries on the first day of bengali new year. Traders send out invitations to old customers and entertain them with sweets.</p>
						<p>In the road, front yard and staircases, miniature Aalponas (traditional art and designs) are drawn by means of bright colors like red, green, blue,  yellow and white. On the face and hand of children and female, aalpona are also drawn to shine their happiness.</p>

						<h3 class="h3_design_block">Kacchi Biryani</h3>
						
						<p>Festivals to many people entail many things, but for a true blue Bengali girl like me, festivals are synonymous with family, traditions and food. Growing up, my family ensured that each festival or parbon as we call them is celebrated with dedicated fervour. Noboborsho, or the Bengali New year, holds a special place in every Bengalis heart, it is yet another opportunity to enjoy, usher in the good times with family and friends over new clothes, elaborate meals and lots of adda. Bengalis and their bhuri bhoj is world famous and we don’t leave any stone unturned when it comes to merrymaking.</p>
						
						<p>A Dhakai Kacchi Biryani is different from the rest of the lot as the here the raw marinated meat is cooked along with the rice in a concoction of flavours. The key is to get the right balance of spices, not too spicy, not to bland, just right with succulent pieces of meat and potatoes. A perfect recipe to bond over with friends and family.</p>
						
						<p>However, no celebration is perfect without a clean home and kitchen. Since the kitchen is the humdrum of activities  during Poila Boisakh, hygiene is of utmost importance. With a young kid at home, I cant help but being hyper when it comes to cleanliness. The advent of summers mean pests and cockroaches and the only sure shot way to get rid of it is to use Godrej Lal Hit.  A premium product from Godrej to keep cockroaches at bay. Its long nozzle ensures that it reaches every nook and corner of your kitchen. Personally, I have been using this product for a while now and I seriously cant complain.</p>
