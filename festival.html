						<h1>Bangladesh Holidays and Festivals</h1>
						<p>Bangladeshi people are keen on incorporating traditions into their daily lives and Bangladesh holidays are a reflection of the unique customs and beautiful mix of culture. Most of the indigenous traditions that center around agricultural practices have been well preserved throughout history, including the festival of the new harvest (Nabonno) and the jovial and colorful celebration of New Year, locally known as Pawhela Boishakh.</p>
